This app lets you get data of cryptocoins from coinmarketcap.com. You get the following data of the top 10 coins:

- Name
- Symbol
- Rank (based on market cap)
- Price in USD
- Price in EUR
- Market cap (USD)
- Volume (USD)
- Percent change in the last 24 hours

It also logs (once per hour) the market cap of the top 10 coins in insights so its easy to compare them against eachother.

Coin info can be fetched automatically (set time-period in settings-page) or manual using the action flow-card.
